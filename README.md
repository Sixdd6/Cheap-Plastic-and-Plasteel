# Organic Plasteel
It is now possible to create Plasteel by combining Plastic and Steel at an Electric Smelter.  

#### Items added:  
Starch - Made at a stove or electric stove.  
Plastic - Made at an electric smelter (Can be purchased/sold and used as construction material).  

#### Task Added in Electric Smelter:  
Make Starch -> 5 Potatoes = 1 Starch  
Make Plastic -> 5 Starch = 1 Plastic  
Make Plasteel -> 5 Plastic + 1 Steel = 1 Plasteel  

#### Upcoming Features (NO ETA)
Ability to combine starch and other materials to make useful things like building materials, fabric and long-term food stocks that will go bad but last significantly longer than normal meals(think pemmican but nicer to eat).
